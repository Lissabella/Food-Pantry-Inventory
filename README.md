# Food Pantry Inventory Tracking

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/food-pantry-inventory/badge/?version=latest)](https://food-pantry-inventory.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Welcome to the Food Pantry Inventory open source project!

This project is designed to track the inventory in the warehouse of a food
pantry.  It tracks boxes of product by location (row, bin, and  tier), contents
(green beans, corn, etc.) and by expiration year.  The expiration can 
optionally be tracked by half-year, quarter, or arbitrary month ranges.

Details of this system are given in the documentation located at docs/source/index.rst.
